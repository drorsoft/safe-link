# Add terms and conditions popup 

## DODâ€”Definition of Done

- There is a button, that displays a popup of the terms and conditions when the user clicks on a button.
- The button should be placed in the footer of the page, before (above) the Drorsoft logo.
- The button should be labeled "Terms and Conditions" with an underline.
- prefer not to use the new `popup` component, but rather use a simple modal.

`Terms and Conditions of Use for Safe-Link
Welcome to Safe-Link! This website ("Safe-Link" or "the Service") is a free-to-use service designed to assist users in checking the potential safety of a provided link. By accessing or using Safe-Link, you ("User" or "you") agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.

1. Acceptance of Terms
   By using Safe-Link, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy (if you develop one). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Safe-Link.

2. Description of Service
   Safe-Link provides a free online tool that attempts to analyze submitted URLs and provide an indication of their potential safety. This service is offered for informational purposes only and is intended to be a helpful resource, not a definitive authority on link security.

3. "As Is" and "As Available" Disclaimer
   The Safe-Link service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, Safe-Link disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and accuracy. Safe-Link does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses or other harmful components.

4. No Guarantee of Accuracy
   While Safe-Link strives to provide useful information, we do not guarantee 100% accuracy, reliability, or completeness in determining if a link is safe. The methodologies used are designed to identify potential threats, but new threats emerge constantly, and some malicious links may not be detected. Conversely, some legitimate links may be flagged incorrectly. You should always exercise caution and discretion when clicking on any link, regardless of Safe-Link's assessment.

5. Limitation of Liability
   In no event shall Safe-Link, its operators, affiliates, or licensors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

The use or inability to use the Service;

The accuracy or inaccuracy of any information provided by the Service;

Unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data;

Statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;

Any other matter relating to the Service.

This limitation of liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Safe-Link has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

6. User Responsibilities
   You agree to use Safe-Link only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of this Service by any third party. You are solely responsible for any links you submit to the Service.

7. Data Privacy
   Safe-Link is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not store any personal data about users. The links submitted for checking are processed for the sole purpose of providing the Service and are not linked to any identifiable user information. For more details, please refer to our Privacy Policy (if applicable).

8. Modifications to Terms
   Safe-Link reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will indicate at the top of these Terms the date of the last revision. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes.

9. Termination
   Safe-Link reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Service, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

10. Governing Law
